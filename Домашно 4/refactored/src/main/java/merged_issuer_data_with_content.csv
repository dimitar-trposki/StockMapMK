Expectations for the upcoming period
The country's macroeconomic condition is expected to remain stable in the upcoming period,
based on economic growth, reduction of unemployment rate, inflation stabilisation and decrease
of policy interest rates.
North Macedonia's 'BB+' rating with a stable outlook was confirmed by the rating agency Fitch
as a result of credible and consistent macroeconomic policies that underpin stable exchange
rate (the de facto fixed exchange rate) of the Denar to the Euro. The acceleration of GDP
growth is expected to be driven by government capital investments in infrastructure projects, as
well as private investments and consumption.
However, uncertainty about future macroeconomic stability continues to exist through the risks
associated with global factors and geopolitical events.
In such circumstances, NLB Banka continues to act in support of the private sector, making a
significant contribution to the country's macroeconomic and financial environment. In addition,
the Bank continues to have a leading position in the field of digitalisation, technological
innovation, the application of artificial intelligence and a strong commitment to environmental
protection and social aspects (ESG).
Digitalisation in NLB Banka is strengthened by improving the capacity of digital channels,
ensuring a higher level of availability of the Bank and better customer experience as well as
customer support by strengthening the role of the contact centre. An additional focus is also on
expanding the range of products and services through the sale of various banking and non-
banking products and increasing the quality of services.
Recognising the risks of climate change, the Bank takes a proactive stance through the given
focus on ""green loans"" – lending in areas of electricity generation from renewable sources,
reducing pollution and improving the environment.Information on changes in the accounting policies and evaluation methods

services marked an increase by 3% compared to the same period of the previous year.
The increase is mainly due to the higher number of post-paid subscribers, as well as increase of the
roaming revenues, and on the other hand there is decline of the revenues from pre-paid mostly due to pre
to post migration as well as the lower spending of voice services in the pre-paid segment. There is increase
of the revenues from non-voice services mostly as a result of the increased revenues from mobile internet
due to higher usage of bundled tariff models with non-voce services as well as the increased GPRS traffic
in roaming.

cost of consumed materials and other supplies including the electricity cost are decreased by 26.8% at

to decline of the electrical energy price as a result of the global movements of the electrical energy price.

period of the previous year mostly due to the decline of the costs for maintenance of the tellecomunication
equipment.
The employee related expenses at the end of the first nine months of 2024 are increased by 16.7% due to
higher number of employees, mostly as a result of in-sourcing of the employees who are performing the
activities related to the managed services. Additionally, the Company has higher expenses for severance
payments and provisions for employee related expenses compared to the same period of the previous
year.
Capital expenditures
The amount of total Capital expenditures (CAPEX), at the end of the first nine months of 2024 is MKD 1,114
millions compared to MKD 1,401.6 millions at the end of the same period of the previous year.
Ukraine conflict and economic crises impact on the business and on the financial
statements
The annual inflation rate is further slowing down and at the end of August 2024 it is on a level of 2.2%, but
it is still above historical average, while the inflation spread compared to the Eurozone marks is still minor.
In accordance to the latest IMF country reports the average inflation rate for 2024 is estimated at around
3.3%. In addition, the annual inflation rate mostly derives from the basic inflation component, while the
slowing of the prices’ growth is result of the more favourable movements in all three components at price
decline of food and energy component and slower growth of the basic inflation, The inflation expectations
are still favourable, considering the European commission surveys in June, in which the expectations for
prices decline in the next period prevail. The revision of the export prices are downward and uncertainty
related to the future dynamics of the basic products prices on the stock exchanges due to geopolitical
tensions and climate changes still remains.1
The ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and the related sanctions targeted against the Russian Federation
as well as the other ongoing military conflicts may have a further impact on the European and the global
economy, apart from the one it already had on the energy prices as discussed above. The Company does
1 NBRSM – Latest macroeconomic indicators Currrent situation overview – September 2024not have any significant direct exposure to Ukraine, Russia or Belarus. However, the impact on the general
economic situation may require revisions of certain assumptions and estimates in the future. Impact of the
crisis has been experienced by the Company through the increased energy prices. The future long-term
impact may also affect the trading volumes, cash flows, and profitability. Nevertheless, except for the
increased energy cost, no other effects of the Ukraine conflict and other ongoing military conflicts have
been experienced by the Company as of the date of these financial statements.

Investigation into certain consultancy contracts
On 13 February 2006, Magyar Telekom Plc., the controlling owner of the Company, (via Stonebridge
Communications AD - Skopje, majority shareholder of the Company), announced that it was investigating certain
contracts entered into by another subsidiary of Magyar Telekom Plc. to determine whether the contracts were entered
into in violation of Magyar Telekom Plc. policy or applicable law or regulation. Magyar Telekom’s Audit Committee
retained White & Case, as its independent legal counsel to conduct the internal investigation. Subsequent to this, on
19 February 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company, based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee of
the Company and the Audit Committee of Magyar Telekom Plc., adopted a resolution to conduct an independent
internal investigation regarding certain contracts in Republic of North Macedonia.
Based on publicly available information, as well as information obtained from Magyar Telekom and as previously
disclosed, Magyar Telekom’s Audit Committee conducted an internal investigation regarding certain contracts
relating to the activities of Magyar Telekom and/or its affiliates in Montenegro and Republic of North Macedonia that
totalled more than EUR 31 million. In particular, the internal investigation examined whether Magyar Telekom and/or
its Montenegrin and Macedonian affiliates had made payments prohibited by U.S. laws or regulations, including the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”). The Company has previously disclosed the results of the internal
investigation.
Magyar Telekom’s Audit Committee informed the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) of the internal investigation. The DOJ and the SEC commenced investigations into
the activities that were the subject of the internal investigation. On 29 December 2011, Magyar Telekom announced
that it had entered into final settlements with the DOJ and the SEC to resolve the DOJ’s and the SEC’s investigations
relating to Magyar Telekom. The settlements concluded the DOJ’s and the SEC’s investigations. Magyar Telekom
disclosed the key terms of the settlements with the DOJ and the SEC on 29 December 2011. In particular, Magyar
Telekom disclosed that it had entered into a two-year deferred prosecution agreement (the “DPA”) with the DOJ. The
DPA expired on 5 January 2014, and further to the DOJ’s request filed in accordance with the DPA, the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia dismissed the charges against Magyar Telekom on 5 February 2014.
In relation to the local investigation by the state authorities in Republic of North Macedonia and further to the
previously disclosed information in the Financial Statements of the Company for the preceding years, in the first
quarter of 2023 the First – instance criminal court issued a non-judicial verdict declaring the three accused former
managers of the Company guilty and ordering them to jointly compensate for the damage. However, based on the
proposal from the Higher Public Prosecution Office, with the 2023 Q4 verdict from the Court of Appeal – Skopje all
charges against the defendants have been dismissed due to reached statute limitation period, as per the latest
changes in the Criminal Code. With this verdict, the criminal case against the defendants is closed, and now the state
can only sue the defendants for compensation of damages in a civil court procedure.
We have not become aware of any information as a result of a request from any regulators or other external parties,
other than the previously disclosed, from which we would have concluded that the financial statements may be
misstated, including from the effects of a possible illegal act.

	INFORMATION ON THE OUTCOME OF THE TAKEOVER BID

	published in the daily newspaper ""Sloboden pechat"" on 26.08.2024 and

	 in the Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia No. 177 as of 26.08.2024

	
		The Takeover Bid was accepted by 149 (one hundred and forty-nine) holders of ordinary shares with voting rights that own a total of 176,154 ordinary shares, i.e. 45.0548% of all shares with voting rights issued by Stopanska Banka AD Bitola.


	
		The Takeover Bid referred to all 390,977 ordinary shares with voting rights issued by Stopanska Banka AD Bitola with ISIN number: MKSBTB101013.


	
		In the Takeover Bid, the success threshold - i.e. the minimum number of ordinary shares which had to be accepted in order for the Takeover Bid to be considered as successful - was set at 261,956 ordinary shares with voting rights, which represents 67% plus 1 share of the total number of ordinary shares with voting rights issued by Stopanska Banka AD Bitola.


	Taking into consideration that the success threshold requirement has not been met, the Takeover Bid for Stopanska Banka AD Bitola by Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje is considered unsuccessful. The reason for this is that sufficient number of shareholders who own ordinary shares with voting rights did not respond positively to the Bank's bid, i.e. they did not give a Statement for accepting the purchase bid at a price of MKD 3,200 per share within the legally prescribed deadline until 22.09.2024.

	Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje would like to wish a lot of success to the shareholders of Stopanska Banka AD Bitola in their future operations.

	 

	Skopje, 24.09.2024

	                                                                                    Board of Directors of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje

	 


	 

	Notification

	 

	Komercijalna Banka has no intention of commenting individual statements of shareholders of Stopanska Banka Bitola, even if they are qualified shareholders. In accordance with the legal regulations, Komercijalna Banka announced a public takeover bid for Stopanska Banka Bitola that contains all important elements such as the bid price of MKD 3,200 per share, the success threshold of 67% plus one share from the total issued shares and the deadline for statements by shareholders by September 22, 2024. All other information is contained in the accompanying Takeover Brochure, attached to the Public Bid. Apart from these legally prescribed documents, Komercijalna Banka has nothing to add or comment on any other statements until the expiry of the legally stipulated deadline. Komercijalna Banka would once again like to point out that this bid would be the first, last and only bid for the purchase of 100% of the shares of Stopanska Banka Bitola.

Comment on the unconsolidated and unaudited
Income Statement and Balance Sheet
of Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje
for the period of 01.01 - 30.09.2024
1. Income Statement
In the period of 01.01-30.09.2024, Komercijalna Banka AD Skopje realized a positive financial
result from its operations in an amount of MKD 4,422.6 million compared to the positive
financial result from the same period last year in the amount of MKD 3,047.7 million, noting
an increase by 45.1%. The planned gross profit for the three quarters of the year is realized by
139.3%. The profit realized before provisioning, which is an indicator of the Bank's operational
capability to cover the operating expenses, has increased by 36.4% compared to the same
period last year. The increase of profit realized before provisioning is mainly due to the
increased other operating income as well as the increased net interest income, and to a lesser
extent due to the increased net fee and commission income and net trading income. The more
significant increase of other operating income compared to the same period last year is a result
of the increased income from capital gains from the sale of foreclosed property, as well as the
increased amount of collected previously written-off claims.
The total operating income realized is in the amount of MKD 6,626.4 million and notes an
increase by 29.5% compared to the same period last year.
The net interest income represents a basic component in the formation of the total operating
income and as at 30.09.2024, notes an increase by 16.2% compared to the same period last
year. The plan for the analyzed period is realized by 113.4%. Interest income notes an increase
by 20.0% as a result of increased placements across all customer categories, whereas a trend
of decrease of interest rates compared to the same period last year is evident only within the
non-residents sector due to the decrease of the three nominal interest rates by the ECB. Within
the rest of the sectors, higher interest rates still persist compared to the same period last year,
in conditions of initiated relaxation of the monetary policy by NBRNM1. Interest expenses have
increased by 58.7% due to the increased time deposits compared to the same period last year.
The net interest margin at Bank’s level has increased from 3.56% at the end of the third quarter
of 2023, to 3.87% as at 30.09.2024.
As at 30.09.2024, the net fee and commission income amounts to MKD 876.0 million and
compared to the same period last year notes an increase by 9.9%, mostly as a result of the
increase in the volume of operations, especially in cards operations. The plan for the analyzed
period is realized by 106.2%.
The net FX gains as at 30.09.2024 amount to MKD 268.0 million and note a small decrease
by 1.2% compared to the same period last year. The plan for the analyzed period is realized by
109.6%.
Other operating income of the Bank as at 30.09.2024 is in the amount of MKD 987.8 million
and notes a more significant increase compared to the same period last year, as a result of the
multiple increase in income from capital gains from the sale of foreclosed property, and to a
lesser extent due to the increased amount of collected previously written-off claims. The income
from the sale of foreclosed property from the debtors Euronikel Industri DOO Vozarci,
Kavadarci and Nova Refraktori DOO Pehcevo recorded in April 2024 has the largest share
within the income from sale of foreclosed property and equipment. The plan is realized by
176.2%.
1
The ECB has reduced the three nominal interest rates on three occasions (in June, September and October) by 25
percentage points each. NBRNM has reduced the interest rate on treasury bills in September 2024 also by 25
percentage points at the level of 6.05%, as compared to 6.30% in September 2023. Interest rates on overnight and 7-
day deposits remained at the same level as in September 2023.
1КБ_доверливо
The operating expenses for the period 01.01-30.09.2024 amount to MKD 1,722.7 million and
compared to the same period last year note an increase by 13.3% mostly as a result of the
increase in other operating expenses, and to a lesser extent due to the increased employees’
salaries and other personnel expenses and increased depreciation. The more significant
increase of other operating expenses refers to the expenses for foreclosed assets, primarily for
the foreclosed property of the client Euronikel Industri Kavadarci, in order to maintain the plant
in good condition for a safe and efficient restarting of the production process. The plan is
realized by 103.5%.
In the period 01.01-30.09.2024, the Bank has recorded net impairment losses on non-
financial assets in the amount of MKD 3.1 million, i.e. 20% of the net value of the foreclosed
property in accordance with NBRNM regulations.
In the reporting period, the Bank recorded an impairment of financial assets and special
provision for off-balance sheet exposures on net basis in the amount of MKD 478.0 million,
compared to MKD 545.3 million in the same period last year. The decrease of impairment of
financial assets is due to the effect of the net additional amount of impairment and performed
write-offs in the reporting period, in accordance with NBRNM regulations.
2. Balance Sheet
The total assets of the Bank, as at 30.09.2024 reached an amount of MKD 168,900.9 million
and compared to December 2023, note an increase by 3.2%. The increase of the total assets
is mainly due to the increased loans and advances to other customers, and to a lesser extent
due to the increased investments in securities and the increased loans and advances to banks.
The plan is realized by 99.2%.
Cash and cash equivalents note a decrease by 8.9% mainly as a result of the decreased
balance of deposits placed with NBRNM (overnight and deposits up to 7 days), whereas the
Bank used the excess liquid assets to support the real sector in order to increase its profitability
and strengthen its market position. At the same time, in the reporting period, the Bank diverted
short-term time deposits and funds on foreign currency accounts abroad to placements in
foreign banks with a maturity of up to one year in order to realize higher yields in conditions of
an initiated cycle of reduction of the nominal interest rates by ECB and FED. The plan is realized
by 86.3%.
Trading assets note an increase by 13.7% as a result of the net effect from trading with shares.
The plan is realized by 120.6%.
Financial assets at fair value through the Income Statement designated as such at the
initial recognition in the amount of MKD 372.5 million consist of investments in stakes in
investment funds.
The loans and advances to banks note an increase by 37.4%, which is mostly due to
increased foreign currency deposits in foreign banks with maturity from 3 months to 1 year in
USD, AUD and CHF currency, in order to achieve higher income in conditions of reduction of
interest rates on the foreign financial markets. The plan is realized by 195.0%.
The loans and advances to other customers note an increase by 14.9% as a result of
increased lending to the non-financial legal entities sector and the household sector. The plan
is realized by 110.8%. The more significant increase is partly due to approved loans related to
the sale of the foreclosed property from Euronikel Kavadarci and related entities that were not
foreseen in the projections for 2024, and partially as a result of the Bank's effort to maintain its
market position in conditions of increased competitive pressures.
Investments in securities have increased by 14.2% mainly due to the increased amount of
subscribed continuous government bonds in denars, and to a lesser extent due to the
subscribed government bonds and government bills in denars available for sale, as well as
subscribed Macedonian Eurobonds and government bonds from non-residents. The plan is
realized by 107.1%.
2КБ_доверливо
Foreclosed assets on the basis of uncollected claims note a more significant decrease
based on the sale of foreclosed property, mainly from the debtors Euronikel Industri DOO
s.Vozarci and Nova Refraktori DOO Pehcevo, and have a minimal participation of 0.02% in the
Bank’s total assets.
Total deposits (deposits from banks and from other customers) reached the amount of
MKD 145.985,9 million and note an increase by 2.0% compared to December 2023. The plan
is realized by 98.6%.
The Bank’s borrowings are in the amount of MKD 1.112.2 million and note an increase by
26.9% compared to December 2023 as a result of the net effect of new withdrawals and paid
due installments under credit lines. They have a minimal participation of 0.7% in the Bank’s
total liabilities and equity and reserves. In the reporting period, funds were withdrawn from the
following credit lines: EIB VII through DBNM (for permanent working capital and investments of
SMEs, mid-market capitalized companies and green transition), DBNM’s credit line for
digitalization, energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, the GEFF III credit line from
EBRD (credit line for energy efficiency of households) and the credit line of the Agricultural
Credit Discount Fund - ACDF 2.The plan is realized by 110.2%.
Share capital and reserves of the Bank as at September 30, 2024 have reached the amount
of MKD 20,358.1 million and compared to December 2023, note an increase by 13.0% as a
result of the realized solid current profit and the increased other reserves on the basis of
redistribution of part of the profit for 2023 in the amount of MKD 1,377.4 million, while MKD 130
million were distributed in retained earnings for investments, in accordance with the Decision
on the distribution of the profit for 2023 adopted by the Shareholders Assembly held on March
27th, 2024. The plan is realized by 103.7%.
3. Expectations for the forthcoming period
The macroeconomic conditions under which the Bank will realize its operations until the end of
2024 are influenced by the domestic political developments, as well as by the persistent
uncertainty and unpredictable global environment and the present risks caused by the following:
the prolonged war in Ukraine and additionally by the worsening of the military conflict in the
Middle East, the weaker growth of the Chinese economy being the second largest in the world,
the recession in Germany as our largest trading partner and the increased financial stress
among highly indebted countries. Such an environment creates risks to the economic growth,
inflation and the external position.
The high level of uncertainty in the domestic economy and on an international level, points to
the need of a more conservative approach in shaping of the expectations for 2024. According
to the latest projections published by the World Bank, it is expected that in 2024 the Macedonian
economy would record a GDP growth rate of only 1.8%, as opposed to its spring projections of
2.5% and the projections of NBRNM published in May, with an estimated GDP growth rate of
2.6%. This downward adjustment is a result of the long-term inflationary pressures, weak
external demand and the delayed construction of infrastructure projects.
The macroeconomic stability in 2024 is expected to be preserved by maintaining the price
stability and the denar – euro nominal exchange rate stability. The average annual inflation at
the end of the third quarter is 3.3%, with an expected further slowdown by the end of 2024.
Nevertheless, the rising risks regarding the inflation are still present and are mainly related to
the following: prices of primary products, changes in regulated prices, as well as demand side
policies (disposable income) and profit margins.
It is expected that the banking system will continue to provide a bit more moderate, but still
solid loan support in conditions of initiated relaxation of the monetary policy, undertaken macro
prudential measures and continuous increase of the rate of the banks’ countercyclical capital
buffer. Credit growth in 2024 would be around 6.1%, while deposit growth is predicted to be
around 7.4%.

4. Information on changes in the accounting policies and evaluation methods
There are no changes in the accounting policies and evaluation methods during the three
quarters of 2024.
5. Dividends paid out
The Bank’s Annual Shareholders Assembly was held on March 27, 2024. An integral part of
the materials for the Assembly were the Decision on allocation and distribution of the
unallocated profit realized up to 31.12.2023 and the Decision on determining the amount and
the dates for payout of the dividend for 2023. In accordance with the proposed decisions, on
April 25, 2024, the Bank completed the payment of the dividend for 2023 to shareholders of
ordinary shares recorded in the Shareholders Register as at April 11, 2024. Out of the total
calculated dividend for 2023 in the amount of MKD 2,073,950,970.00, corporate shareholders
have been paid a total amount of MKD 1,060,754,240.00 and a dividend in a total amount of
MKD 1,013,196,730.00 was paid to individual shareholders. The amount of dividend per share
was MKD 910.00, i.e. 91.0% of the nominal value of the share.
6. Investments in or sale of tangible assets (real estate, plants and equipment) or
significant write-off (exceeding 30% of the asset’s value, compared to the latest
audited financial statements)
As at September 30, 2024, the real estate and equipment note a decrease by 0.6% compared
to December 2023, mainly as a result of accrued depreciation.
7. Changes in the credit indebtedness (decrease or increase exceeding 30%)
As at September 30, 2024, the borrowings note an increase by 26.9% compared to December
2023, but hold a minimal share of 0.7% in the Bank’s total liabilities and equity and reserves.
The increase is a result of a larger amount of new withdrawals compared to the amount of
regular repayments of due loan installments under the loan agreements. In the reporting period,
funds were withdrawn from the following credit lines: EIB VII through DBNM (for permanent
working capital and investments of SMEs, mid-market capitalized companies and green
transition), DBNM’s credit line for digitalization, energy efficiency and renewable energy
sources, the GEFF III credit line from EBRD (credit line for energy efficiency of households)
and the credit line of the Agricultural Credit Discount Fund - ACDF 2.
